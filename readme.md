#• The <head> section comprises of metadata for the document, For illustration character encoding, viewport settings, and the title of the page.
#• In this code, there is an empty <style> block where you can add your CSS styles.
#• The <title> element sets the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
#• The <script> tag is utilized to encompasses external JavaScript code. In this case, it includes the Axios library from a content delivery network (CDN-Content-Delivery-Network). Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests.
<body><header><h1>Mental Health Care App</h1><buttonid="refreshBtn">Refresh Data</button><inputtype="text"id="searchInput"placeholder="Search..."></header><main><divid="dataContainer"></div></main>
#• Inside the <header> element, there is an <h1> heading displaying the title of the app, followed by a <button> element with the id refreshBtn, and an <input> element with the id searchInput.
#• The <main> section represents the main content of the web page.
#• Inside the <main> element, there is a <div> element with the id dataContainer. This is where the fetched data will be rendered.
    #<script>
        constrefreshBtn = document.getElementById('refreshBtn');
        constsearchInput = document.getElementById('searchInput');
        constdataContainer = document.getElementById('dataContainer');
#letallData = [];
#constfetchData= async() => {
            try{
                constresponse = awaitaxios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
                allData = response.data;
                renderData(allData);
            } catch(error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
        };
#• This script section contains JavaScript code.
#• The const keyword is used to declare three variables: refreshBtn, searchInput, and dataContainer. They are assigned values based on the elements with corresponding IDs in the HTML.
#• The let keyword is used to declare the allData variable, which will store the fetched data.
#• The fetchData function is an asynchronous function that uses await to make an HTTP GET request to 'https://api.example.com/data' using the Axios library.
#• If the request is successful, the response data is stored in the allData variable and passed to the renderData function.
#• If there is an error, it is logged to the console.
        const renderData = (data) => {
           # dataContainer.innerHTML = '';
#data.forEach((item) => {
                #const card = document.createElement('div');
                #card.classList.add('card');
                #card.innerHTML = `

                #dataContainer.appendChild(card);
            #});
        #};
#• The renderData function takes the data parameter and is responsible for rendering the #data in the DOM. Begins deom clearing the content of the dataContainer element by setting #its innerHTML to an empty string.
#• It then iterates over each item in the data array and creates a new <div> element with the CSS class 'card'.
#• Finally, it appends the newly created <div> to the dataContainer element.
        const searchFilter = (event) => {
           #const searchTerm = event.target.value.toLowerCase();
            #const filteredData = allData.filter((item) => {
                #return item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm);
            #});
           # renderData(filteredData);
        #};
#• The searchFilter function is called when the input event is triggered on the searchInput #element.
##• It retrieves the value of the input field and converts it to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive search.
#• It uses the filter method on the allData array to create a new array filteredData that only contains items whose names include the search term.
#• It then calls the renderData function to display the filtered data.
        refreshBtn.addEventListener('click', fetchData);
        searchInput.addEventListener('input', searchFilter);
#document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fetchData);
    </script>
#• These lines add event listeners to the refreshBtn button and searchInput input field.
#• When the click event is triggered on the refreshBtn, it calls the fetchData function to fetch data from the API.
#• When the input event is triggered on the searchInput, it calls the searchFilter function to filter the data based on the input value.
##The DOMContentLoaded event listener is added to the document object and calls the fetchData function when the DOM content is fully loaded.

##Pseudocode: for index.html: The fetchData function is an asynchronous function that uses the Axios library to make a GET request to the specified API endpoint (https://api.illustration.com/data). It captures the response and assigns it to the allData variable. Then, it calls the renderData function to display the data in the data container.

##The renderData function takes an array of data as a parameter and clears the content of the data container. It iterates over each item in the array and creates a card element for each item, displaying its name and description. The card element is then appended to the data container.

#The searchFilter function is triggered when there is an input event on the search input field. It retrieves the value of the search input, converts it to lowercase, and filters the allData array based on whether the item's name includes the search term. The filtered data is then passed to the renderData function to display the filtered results in the data container.

#Event listeners are added to the refresh button and search input field. When the refresh button is clicked, the fetchData function is called to fetch the data again and update the display. When there is an input event on the search input field, the searchFilter function is called to filter the data based on the search term.

##In conclusion, the DOMContentLoaded event listener is added to call the fetchData function when the HTML document has finished loading. This ensures that the data is fetched and displayed when the page is first loaded.
##Asynchronous JS is a programming methodology which permits your program to begin possibly extended running task at the same time being responsive to other events whereas the task then runs instead of having to wait until that specified task has been concluded.. Once the program has been concluded the program has been presented with the expected occurence.

##index.js:const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const path = require('path');

const port = 3000;

// Serve static files from the public folder
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Define route for the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
##Pseudocode:index.js:index.js file: Express server that serves static files and has a route for the root URL. It listens on port 3000.
